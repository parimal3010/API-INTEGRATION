*This project is a sleek, interactive web application that provides real-time weather information for any city in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows users to input a city name and fetch live weather details with a single click.

The interface is designed to be both visually engaging and user-friendly. A full-screen looping video of rainfall (rain.mp4) plays in the background, adding a calm and immersive atmosphere. The input form and results are displayed clearly over this video, maintaining readability and focus.

Key features include:
Live Weather Data
Sunrise & Sunset Times
